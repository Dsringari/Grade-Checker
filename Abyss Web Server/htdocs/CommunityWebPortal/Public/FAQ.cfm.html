	<div class="faqAnswer">If you can't log in to the Community Web Portal, it may be because cookies are disabled in your web browser.

	<div class="faqQuestion"><a name="REGISTER_1"></a>After registering I received this message: Thank you for registering. An email will be sent to you shortly containing your new PIN. Use the new pin to login to the Sapphire Community Web Portal. I never received an email with the new PIN. What do I do now? </div>
	<div class="faqAnswer">Here are a couple of possible reasons and work arounds for this occurrence:
		<ul>
			<li>Your workplace or home service provider (ISP) has a firewall or spam blocker in place which is causing our email to be undeliverable. (Use an alternate email address or ask your network administrator/service provider to release messages received from the District's IP address)</li>
			<li>The District's Domain Name Server (DNS) is down and outbound messages are being held in a queue until service is restored.</li>
			<li>You may have a spam filter set up in your email which misakenly marked the email from Sapphire as spam.</li>
			<li>To get your PIN, contact the Community Web Portal site administrator at your student's school and request that they access your account and resend your PIN to you.</li>
