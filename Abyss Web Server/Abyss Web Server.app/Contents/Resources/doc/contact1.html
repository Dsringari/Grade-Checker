>				By design, MacOS X allows the users' applications
				to only use ports ranging from 1024 to 65535. Using ports 1 to 1023 is only possible when authorized by an administrator of the system. Concretely,
				without activating ports below 1024, you will not be able to have your web server use the default web port 80. But this is not a major problem since
				the server can use any other port.
			</P
><P
>				Since it is the first time you run Abyss Web Server, you are invited to activate the ports below 1024. If you are an administrator of the system, proceed with the
				authentication by entering your system login and password. Otherwise, any administrator of your system can activate these ports for you. All he/she needs
				to do is to authenticate himself/herself to the system to grant you the privilege to use these ports from now on. If you choose to skip the activation of ports
				below 1024 because no administrator is available, there is no problem. You can do it later at any time.
